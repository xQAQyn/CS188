# Search

## agent

- Reflex agent: 
  - definition:
    - choose action based on current percept (and maybe memory)
    - May have a memory or a model of the world's current state
    - Do not consider the future consequences of their action
    - Consider how the world **is**
  - in short, just like greedy algorithm's way of search
  - props:
    - can react quickly: like quickly close eyes when a insect jumped on your face
  - cons:
    - sometimes can't be rational: the 'greedy' way is not always right
- Planning agent
  - definition:
    - Ask "What if I do..."
    - Decision based on consequence of the actions
    - Must have a model of how the world evolves in response to actions
    - Must formulate a goal
    - Consider how the world **would be**
  - in short: the planning agent tries some ways and find the answer according to the consequense
  - props: 
    - rational: can optimize expected utility
  - cons:
    - takes too long time
  - optimal vs. complete planning:
    - complete planning: try to find all the existing solutions 
    - optimal: achieve goals in minimal cost 
  - planning vs. replanning:
    - planning: get the consequence of a sequence of actions and find the best sequence
    - replanning: planning a simple step of move, then after this move, replanning the next step

## Search Problem

- definition:
  - Search problem is consist of:
    - a state space
    - a successor function (with actions and its cost)
    - a start state and a goal test
  - Solution: a sequence of actions to transfer the start state to a goal state
- state space: 
  - world state: every last detail of the environment
  - search state: details needed for search (abstraction)

## Search Strategies

### BFS & DFS

- BFS vs. DFS:
  - BFS: can find the shortest path more quickly (but not always)
  - DFS: use less memory properties
- Iterative deepening:
  - goal: get the DFS's spacing advantage with BFS's time/ shallow-solution advantages
  - idea: limit the depth of DFS. If no solution, expand the limitation

### Uniform Cost Search

- Uniform Cost Search: just like Dijkstra used on tree
- props: 
    - UCS is complete and optimal
    - UCS is stable
- cons: 
    - Explore in every direction (maybe wasteful and slow)
    - No information about goal location

### Search Heuristics & Greedy Search

- A heuristics function is:
  - a function that estimates how close a state is to a goal state
  - Designed for a particular search problem
- A heuristics function should be:
  - easy to calculate
  - can roughly measure how close the state is to the goal
- Strategy (greedy): expand to the node that you think (heuristics tells) is closest to the goal
  - Common case: takes you straight to the goal
  - Worst case: like a bad-guided DFS
- props: fast
- cons: maybe wrong

### A* Search

- idea: use both backward cost and (estimate of) forward cost

- implement:

  - define a **admissibility** heuristics function to estimate forward cost
  - always expand the fringe node whose $f(n)$ is smallest
    - $f(n)=g(n)+h(n)$, $g(n)$ is backward cost, $h(n)$ is estimate of forward cost

- **important**: an admissibility heuristics. It should be

  - slow down bad plans, but never outweigh true plans

  - the heuristics $h(n)$ is admissibility if: ($h^*(n)$ is the true cost to the nearest goal)
    $$
    0\le h(n) \le h^*(n)
    $$

  - technique: define two or more heuristics $h_a(n),h_b(n),...$ï¼Œlet $h(n)=max(h_a(n),h_b(n),...)$, the $h(n)$ will be closer to $h(n)$

#### Graph Search by A*

- idea: never expand a state twice
- Way to implement:
  - store the checked state and if we arrive the state again, skip it

- **warning**: the admissibility heuristics may not figure out the optimal solution in the graph
- A consistent heuristics for graph should be:
  - $h(n)\le the\space actual\space cost \space to \space goal$
  - $h(u)-h(v)\le the \space actual \space cost \space from \space u \space to \space v$
  - Deduce from the two conditions, we know that the heuristics should keep $f(n)$ never decrease along a path

## Summary

- Optimality: 
  - for tree: admissibility
  - for graph: consistent (consistent implies admissibility)
