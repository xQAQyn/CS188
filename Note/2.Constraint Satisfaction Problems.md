# Constraint Satisfaction Problems

## What is Search for?

- Assumptions:

  - a single agent
  - deterministic actions
  - fully observed state
  - discrete state space

- Classify:

  - Planning: focus on the sequences of actions

    - The path and goal are important
    - Path have various costs, depths
    - Heuristics give problem-specific guidance

  - Identification: focus on assignment
    - only the goal is important
    - All the path at the same depth
    - CSPs are a specialized class of identification problems

## CSP

- Definition:
  - A special subset of search problem
  - State is defined by variables $X_i$, which values from a domain $D$
  - Goal test is *a set of constraints* specifying allowable combinations of values for subset of  variables
- Necessary component for a CSP:
  - Variable
  - Domain 
  - Constraints
    - implicit: provide code to execute
    - explicit: provide a list of legal tuples
- Complexity:
  - general: $O(d^n)$
  - if constraint graph has no loop: $O(nd^2)$ (see in CSP in tree)
- Basic Solution: backtracking search

## Backtracking

- Idea:
  - assign one variable at a time
  - check constraints as you go 
- Ways of improving backtracking:
  - Ordering:
    - which variable should be assigned next? (MRV)
    - in what order should its values be tried? (LCV)
  - Filtering:
    - can we detect failure early?
  - Structure:
    - Can we exploit the problem structure?

### Consistency

- 1-consistency (node consistency): Each single node has a value which meets that node's constraints
- 2-consistency (arc consistency): For each pair of nodes, any consistent assignment to one can be extended to the other
- k-consistency: For each k nodes, any consistent assignment to k-1 node can be extended to the kth node 
- strong k-consistency: meet k-consistency, (k-1)-consistency, ... ,1-consistency
  - n-consistency means we can solve the problem without backtracing

### Filtering

#### Forward Checking

- idea: cross off the values in the domain of unassigned variable which will violate the constraints when assigning a variable
- Forward checking can enforce the consistency of arcs pointing to each new assignment

#### Constraint Propagation

- Algorithms: AC3

- Goal: to enforce the arc consistency

- AC3 algorithms just like SPFA(by queue) used in enforce the arc consistency

  - pseudo-code:

    ```
    function AC3(csp) returns the CSP, possibly with reduced domains
    	inputs: csp, a binary CSP with variables{x1,x2,...,xn}
    	local variables: queue, a queue of arcs, initially all the arcs in csp
    	
    	while queue is not empty do
    		(Xi,Xj) <- pop(queue)
    		if REMOVE-INCOSISTENT-VALUES(Xi,Xj) then
    			for each Xk in NEIGHBORS[Xi] do
    				add (Xk,Xi) to queue
    				
    function REMOVE-INCOSISTENT-VALUES(Xi,Xj) returns true if succeeds
    	removed <- false
    	for each x in DOMAIN[Xi] do
    		if no value y in DOMAIN[Xj] allows (x,y) satisfy the constraint Xi <-> Xj
    			then delete x from DOMAIN[Xi]
    			removed <- true
    	return removed
    ```

### Ordering

- which variable should be assigned next? (MRV)
  - choose the most difficult variable: choose the variable which has the smallest domains

### Structure

#### CSP for Tree

- complexity: $O(nd^2)$
  - claims:
    - After backward pass, all root-to-leaf arc are consistent
    - If root-to-leaf arcs are consistent, forward tracking will not backtrack

#### Nearly Tree-Structured CSPs

- algorithm1: delete node until it becomes a tree
  - implement:
    - delete a small number of node to get a tree
    - enumerate all possible value of deleted nodes
    - use CSP for tree on it
  - Complexity: $O(d^c(n-c)d^2)$
- algorithm2: tree decomposition
  - idea: create a tree of mega-variables
    - mega-variables: pack some variable together, and constraints between mage-variables is to stay the shared variables the same

## Interactive Algorithms for CSPs

- ideaï¼š

  - random generate an assignment with unsatisfied constraints
  - use operators to reassign variable values

- pseudo-code:

  ```
  function interactiveCSP(csp)
  	variables <- random element in its domain
  	while not solved
  		var <- random select confilicted variable
  		var.value <- ValueSelection(var)
  
  function ValueSelection(var) returns a value that heuristics think will be min-conflicts
  ```

- performance: often very fast, but sometimes need a lot of time

## Summary

- CSP basic solution: backtracking search
- Speed-ups:
  - Ordering
  - Filtering
  - Structure
- Interactive min-conflicts is often effective in practice

## Extension: Stimulated Annealing

pseudo-code:

```
function StimulatedAnnealing(problem,schedule) returns a solution state
	inputs: problem, schedule: a map from time to temperature
	local variables: next: a node
							current: a node
							T: temperature
	for i <- 1 to inf do
		T <- schedule[i]
		if T = 0 return current
		next <- a random select successor of current
        dE <- value[next] - value[current]
        if dE > 0 
        	current <- next
        else 
        	current <- next only with probability e^{dE/T}
```
